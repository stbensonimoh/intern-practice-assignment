## Question 1 (Git and Version Control)
Create a `Git` repository and give it a name of your choice. Upload your repo to GitHub and add @stbensonimoh and @osumgbachiamaka as collaborators.

Store your answers to each question in separate files/folders and name them appropriately likes so: `question-1.js` or where the question requires you to create `html`, `css`, and `javascript` files, you can create a folder with `question-1` as the folder name.

Make sure you make `atomic commits` with proper commit messages.

## Question 2 (The Script Tag)
**Internal Script**
Create a `html` page that shows an alert message `I am a Software Engineer in the making`.

**External Script**
Take the solution from the previous task and modify it by extracting the script content to an external file `external.js` and attach it to the html file as an external script tag. Ensure that it works.

Make sure that you code is well commented.

## Question 3 (Data types and Variables)
Create a file called `variables-and-data-types.js`.
In that file, on line `1` create a varaible and assign the name of the Governor of your state to that variable.
Log the variable name to the console using `console.log()`

On line `4`, create a variable called `isAResidentOfVONGardenEstate` and assign a `boolean` value of your choice to it.

## Question 4 (Type Conversions)
Create a file called `type-conversions.js`
In that file, create a variable with a type of `String` and takes the number 25.
On the next line, create another variable and assign a converted `Number` value of the previous variable to it.
Log the new variable to the console.
Log the type of the new variable to the console, e.g. `console.log(tyepof(newVariable))`. Make sure to use nice and proper variable names.

## Question 5 (Functions and Built-in Javascript Functions)
Create a file called `functions.js`

In the file, create a function called `sayTodaysDate()` that accepts a `name` argument and logs a greeting to the console like so: `Hello Olive, today's date is 15th of January, 2015`.

**hint**: The function should use the name argument passed in as `String` to do the greeting. It should also use the built-in `Date()` function in Javascript to get the current date. It can also use the `toLocale()` method to format the date appropriately.

Secondly, create a function that takes in two numbers as arguments and returns a sum of both numbers to the console. **Note**: The fuction should still run properly, even if the numbers are passed in as `String`.
